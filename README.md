# CS-207 - Four Step Sequencer/Synthesizer

DESCRIPTION:

The aim of this project is to build a device that both functions as a simple synthesizer as well as a four-step sequencer. 

This project focuses on the creation of an Arduino sketch (program) which will rely on a sound synthesis library called Mozzi to output a variety of sound waveforms. A physical interface will be constructed consisting of inputs like: switches, knobs and sliders that will be used to take in user inputs and will alter or modify the sound being output by the synthesizer. Furthermore the project will look at arranging the synthesized sound in to a pattern of notes (a sequence) which the user can also manipulate through user inputs.
